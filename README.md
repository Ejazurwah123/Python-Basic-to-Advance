## File 1

In this question, you have been given two text files in Urdu. The first file contains an Urdu dictionary, which consists of a list of words. 
The second file contains sentences that do not have spaces between the words and are difficult to read.
 آجخودبخشہوں
This sentence, without proper word segmentation, is difficult to understand. However, with proper word segmentation, the sentence can be separated into individual words. :
 آج خود بخش ہوں
This makes the sentence much easier to read and understand.
This task involves performing maximum matching using the provided Urdu dictionary. 
You need to insert spaces appropriately in sentences that lack spaces between words. 
Here's a breakdown of the process:
• Utilize the Urdu dictionary to identify and match words from the sentences.
• Apply the maximum matching approach to find the longest words in the dictionary that match the sentence.
• Insert spaces after the matched words to separate them.

## File 2
This question is about automatic spelling correction in Urdu . 
Studies have shown that the majority of typing errors are caused by let's assume the dictionary contains the word “پاکستان“. :
1. Omitting one letter, e.g., the input word is “پاکتان“.
2. Adding an extra letter, e.g., the input word is “پاکستانف“.
3. Mistyping one letter, e.g., the input word is “پاکسطان“.
4. Transposing two adjacent letters, e.g., the input word is “پاسکتان“.
With the aid of a dictionary, word processing systems can often detect and automatically correct these kinds
of spelling errors.

The Problem:
You are to write a program that recognizes the four kinds of errors described above.
The Input:
The input should be the file wrong.txt which contains wrong words which you have to corrected.
