## File 1

In this question, you have been given two text files in Urdu. The first file contains an Urdu dictionary, which consists of a list of words. The second file contains sentences that do not have spaces between the words and are difficult to read.
 آجخودبخشہوں
This sentence, without proper word segmentation, is difficult to understand. However, with proper word segmentation, the sentence can be separated into individual words:
 آج خود بخش ہوں
This makes the sentence much easier to read and understand.
This task involves performing maximum matching using the provided Urdu dictionary. You need to insert spaces appropriately in sentences that lack spaces between words. Here's a breakdown of the process:
• Utilize the Urdu dictionary to identify and match words from the sentences.
• Apply the maximum matching approach to find the longest words in the dictionary that match the sentence.
• Insert spaces after the matched words to separate them.
